## altdoc 0.1.0.9000 (development)

#### Breaking changes

- Vignettes are no longer automatically added to the file that defines the structure
  of the website. Developers must now manually update this structure and the order
  of their articles.

#### Major changes

- `update_docs()` now updates the package version as well as altdoc version in
  the footer.

- The NEWS or Changelog file included in the docs now automatically links issues,
  pull requests and users (only works for projects on Github).

- Vignettes are now always rendered by `use_*()` or `update_docs()`. Therefore,
  the argument `convert_vignettes` is removed. Previously, they were only rendered
  if their content changed. This was problematic because the code in a vignette
  can have different output while the vignette in itself doesn't change ([#37](https://github.com/etiennebacher/altdoc/issues/37), [#38](https://github.com/etiennebacher/altdoc/issues/38)).

- New argument `custom_reference` in `use_*()` and `update_docs()`. If it is a
  path to a custom R file then it uses this file to build the "Reference" section
  in the docs ([#35](https://github.com/etiennebacher/altdoc/issues/35)).
