  path = ".",
  overwrite = FALSE,

}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Path. Default is the package root (detected with \code{here::here()}).}

\item{overwrite}{Overwrite the folder 'docs' if it already exists. If \code{FALSE}
(default), there will be an interactive choice to make in the console to
overwrite. If \code{TRUE}, the folder 'docs' is automatically overwritten.}

\item{custom_reference}{Path to the file that will be sourced to generate the
"Reference" section.}

\item{theme}{Name of the theme to use. Default is basic theme. See Details
section.}
}
\value{
No value returned. Creates files in folder 'docs'. Other files and
folders are not modified.

Note that vignettes are no longer automatically added to the file that
defines the structure of the website. Developers must now manually update
this structure and the order of their articles. The name of the file defining
the structure of the website lives at the root of \verb{/docs} and differs based
on the selected site builder (\code{use_docsify()} = \verb{_sidebar.md};
\code{use_docute()} = \code{index.html}; \code{use_mkdocs()} = \code{mkdocs.yml}).
